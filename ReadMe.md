# PC GraphGym Submodule

This repository contains a custom extension of the GraphGym research library for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) using PyTorch. The project aims to transform GraphGym into a more efficient and convenient predictive coding library.

## Features

Extends GraphGym, a research library for GNNs using PyTorch
Implements predictive coding techniques for GNNs
Optimizes performance and speeds up training and inference

## Installation

Clone the PyTorch Geometric repository:
bash
Copy code
```
git clone https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric.git
```
Replace the original GraphGym submodule with this custom module:
bash
Copy code

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pc-graphgym-submodule.git pytorch_geometric/graphgym
```

## Usage

Follow the instructions and examples provided in the PyTorch Geometric repository to utilize the extended GraphGym submodule in your GNN experiments.

## Contributing

Your contributions to improve and extend this custom module are greatly appreciated! Please submit issues and pull requests on the GitHub repository.
